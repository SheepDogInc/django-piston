What is this?
=============

This is a fork of the django-piston project that we're taking under our wing
here at SheepDogInc. After seeing ~160 forks on bitbucket, and ~20 forks on
github, We're going to do our best to keep this up to date with community
contributions, as well as our own.

The original project is hosted here: https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/wiki/Home
